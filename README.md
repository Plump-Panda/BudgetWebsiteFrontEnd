This is a Budgeting Web App created using React and connected to an Express backend I've created [here](https://github.com/Plump-Panda/BudgetAppBackend)

This app pulls account data from your bank account using the [Plaid API](https://plaid.com/). None of your bank details are saved.

To run the app:
```npm run start```
